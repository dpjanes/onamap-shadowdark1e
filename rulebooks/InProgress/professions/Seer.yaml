      You can cast seer spells you know. You know one tier 1 spell of your choice from the seer spell list.
      
      Each time you gain a level, you choose a new seer spell to learn according to the Seer Spells Known table.
      
      You use your Wisdom stat to cast seer spells. The DC is 10 + the spell's tier.
      
      If you fail a spellcasting check, you can't cast that spell again until you complete a rest. If you roll a natural 1 on a spellcasting check, you can't cast that spell again until you complete Seer Penance.
